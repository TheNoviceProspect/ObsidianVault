check also my [[AV Editing/OBS Cheatsheet]] for shortcuts

We also need a [[Templates/Recording Checklist]] that I need to  check before I hit start.

The checklist is now a template that we can inherit


Additionally the following OBS Plugins are installed : StreamElements and ChapterMarker

Capture comes straight from the MiraBox Capture Card, so we ignore Game Capture and Desktop Capture

For the webcam @720p I'm using settings for the Microsoft [[AV Editing/M$ Livecam settings]]

Ideas to try out for future recording/streams to make failures less likely [[Streaming/Best Practices]]

There's also a new tool from NVidia called "Broadcast" it allows you to apply camera and microphone filters before obs ever sees the media-stream
So instead of applying filters in OBS/Streamlabs you can simply set up you cam/mic with NV's technologies and feed those sources into OBS as-is :D
I will describe my new [[AV Editing/Improved Filters]] setup
