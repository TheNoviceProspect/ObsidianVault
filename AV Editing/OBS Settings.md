check also my [[AV Editing/OBS Cheatsheet]] for shortcuts

We also need a [[Templates/Recording Checklist]] that I need to  check before I hit start.

The checklist is now a template that we can inherit 

Additionally the following OBS Plugins are installed : StreamElements and ChapterMarker

Capture comes straight from the MiraBox Capture Card, so we ignore Game Capture and Desktop Capture
