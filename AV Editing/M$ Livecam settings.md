Microsoft Live Cam: 
add a filter to your webcam (video) source called "Nvidia Background Removal" 
Use the "Performance" mode with a threshold of 1.00 and a mask refresh every 4 frames

Additionally I am also using a "Crop/Pad" Filter to cut the image down to just my face area, so in the case of 720p I'm taking 200 pixel off the left and right side, with the camera at literal arms-length..
