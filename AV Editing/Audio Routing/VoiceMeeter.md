VoiceMeeter takes input from [[AV Editing/Audio Routing/NVidia Broadcast]] and whatever comes from the [[AV Editing/Audio Routing/Windows Desktop]]

Output is routed such that A1 is my "monitor" (whatever Bluetooth headset I am wearing) and A2 points to the [[AV Editing/Audio Routing/MiraBox]] HDMI output
