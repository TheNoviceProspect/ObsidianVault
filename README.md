# The Novice Prospects Obsidian Vault
A collaborative knowledge-base

(This file mainly exist because of Github)

## How to work with this
- First obviously download Obsidian from https://obsidian.me
- The you'll want to create a folder on your device where all your Obsidian Vaults are going to live
- Then you should be able to `git clone https://github.com/TheNoviceProspect/ObsidianVault.git ./TNP-Vault/`
- Finally open `~/YourVaultFolder/TNP-Vault/` as a Vault in Obsidian.

I would recommend to allow the usage of community plugins to get the most out of this KB.

>Remember, each Vault has its *own* set of plugins.
>Whatever plugins you may have enabled in your 'private' vault have **no** bearing on this vault (or any other) and vice-versa.
