# Journal for 2022-07-26

<< [[2022-07-25]] | [[2022-07-27]]>>

So, had a bit of a bad night, got the most horrendous kink in my neck since yesterday, and everytime I moved during the night it hurt.

Yeah I'm feeling a wee bit tired, but I am determined to continue my recording(s) for Satisfactory and get further in my journey to learn Satisfactory Modding..
let's see what else the day brings :D

Managed to burn the seasoning of my cast iron pan, so it was dinner for V and Gradon only (as usual, lol) Had a wee rant how someone (G) has to be "asked" to do chores all the time, but that's sorted as well :D

Finally, I managed to put something together for making timelapses a lot less painful: https://github.com/TheNoviceProspect/FicsitCam-AHK

Actually quite proud of the fact that this was constructed entirely by RTFM'ing, and after a few swears and setbacks, I can confirm that I've got a working solution. Next step, get the mod author to PR it or at least make a reference to the project.
.. and of course I can't leave stuff alone, I've gots to fiddle with it!
So another 2/3 commits to the repo, but I feel accomplished, in that I created something from beginning to an end-product (as it were)
