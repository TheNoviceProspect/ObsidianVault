# Journal for 2022-07-28

<< [[2022-07-27]] | [[2022-07-29]]>>

So not a good night, got up again at 1:30am and finally managed to get back to sleep at 3:45.
When I woke up around 9:30 i was still knackered, so I got some kip, and I feel a bit better now.

Funny thing is, there was nothing going on in my head to warrant being awake, but then again 2 cans of relentless at night time are probably not helping ;)

Gotta be careful with leccy the day, only a fiver left in it, well only up till 6pm then we'll be fine.

Managed to hold off on leccy getting turned off and made a decent-ish dinner for everybody(ish)

I have NOT recorded TWEG, cannot get motivated!

I think the fact that my dad decided after all his spiel not to come, is waying heavier on my mind than I'd like to admit.

But at the end of the day he just doesn't feel it necessary to hold his "promises" to me. And I've got to learn to deal with it, since it is really not anything new, oh well.

I'll still try and have a good day with **MY** family, his loss...
