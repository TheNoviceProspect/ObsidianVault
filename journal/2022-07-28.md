# Journal for 2022-07-28

<< [[2022-07-27]] | [[2022-07-29]]>>

So not a good night, got up again at 1:30am and finally managed to get back to sleep at 3:45.
When I woke up around 9:30 i was still knackered, so I got some kip, and I feel a bit better now.

Funny thing is, there was nothing going on in my head to warrant being awake, but then again 2 cans of relentless at night time are probably not helping ;)

Gotta be careful with leccy the day, only a fiver left in it, well only up till 6pm then we'll be fine.
