# Journal for 2022-07-25

<< [[2022-07-23]] | [[2022-07-25]]>>

All in all a really good Monday. I've slept well and I've also managed to do two things for my channel.
I managed a 1:30hr stream of No Man's Sky and then also recorded some more footage for Satisfactory, including some timelapse footage.

Doing that, however, I have decided to create a little mod for Ficsit-Cam. Something that will give me buttons to start and stop and create timelapses, maybe I will figure out the authors mod and suggest a PR (ideally)

Other than that, none of my usual demons reared their ugly head.

I've made a nice dinner for V and managed to get a *real* good feed through Gradon and V making awesome chicken sizzlers :smile: 

I'm looking forward to sleep now, since I really feel like I've had a productive day (even done the dishes before dinner ;) )
