# Journal for 2022-07-23

<< [[2022-07-22]] | [[2022-07-24]]>>

While Steam is updating my games, lets have wee recap of yesterday/ last night;

I've actually slept well (after taking my tablet) and had no nightmares. Awesome.

You'd think that I would be used to that sort of disappointment by now, but nope; It still hurts when you basically get told that your own father has more important priorities than his own son.

But its fine, I have a family that actually treats each other as family, even though they can be a pain in the arse ;) Love em to bits

I'm planning on just sniping a ton of people in SE3 before I can move onto SE4. I might also do some DSP or some such game.

Note to self: keep *THIS* going, it helps you!!!

nighttime: I've been playing a lot of SE and some DSP, now watching videos, maybe play some more.

but seriously, keep writing this journal it is good practice for yourself.
