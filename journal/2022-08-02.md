# Journal for 2022-08-02

<< [[2022-08-01]] | [[2022-08-03]]>>

Even though I have not recorded or streamed a single minute of footage I have been busy re-arranging my desk
I mean the result speaks for itself

I managed to clean up completely under my desk, Foghorn has moved and now 7of9 lives on top of it.

All in I feel shattered but well-accomplished with my achievement today. Everything has either a place on my desk or in a box underneath.

I finally feel like this is the workspace I've always wanted but was too lazy to implement, lol.

eg: I am writing this on Foghorn, as I am ssh'ed onto schleppi running obisidian.md via remote X11. What a time to be alive in.

On on that note let's actually acknowledge how much I've always wanted this. A home, a family, a place where I belong.

I've also not felt in long time like I need to "run"; looks like I am actually settling, as much as I never believed I deserved that (or would be lucky enough to find it)

So really it has been an amazing couple of days (also due to me starting to write this to finally deal with my psyche). All I need to do now, is to get rid of my addictions, because realistically there is no need for those "*crutches*" anymore. But all in good time.. now it is time to headbang to "Lamb of God - Walk with Me in Hell"
