# Journal for 2022-07-22

Yesterdays entry has actually been made today:
But I am not happy...

Woke up with traces of nightmares lingering; the usual: Rita berating me and this time she went to far.. "Du nennst *das* eine Familie??"
I'm glad to report that my dream-self actually stood up to her. Because I can say with ertainty that what I have now is ***actually*** a family. What ever she called what the MzB's from Oberndorf did, it wasn't family, I *know* that!

So I am glad that Veronica has been so understanding and supporting of me in the last two days.
