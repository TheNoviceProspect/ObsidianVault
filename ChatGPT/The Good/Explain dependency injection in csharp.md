Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming to reduce coupling 
between classes and make them more modular and easier to maintain.

In C#, dependency injection involves passing the dependencies of an object as constructor parameters or 
properties instead of creating them internally within the object. This makes the object more flexible 
and reusable, as it can be easily configured to use different dependencies without modifying the code.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```csharp
public interface IEmailService
{
    void SendEmail(string to, string subject, string body);
}

public class EmailService : IEmailService
{
    public void SendEmail(string to, string subject, string body)
    {
        // code to send email
    }
}

public class MyController
{
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public MyController(IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        _emailService.SendEmail("user@example.com", "Hello", "World");
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyController` depends on an `IEmailService` instance to send emails. Instead of creating an instance of `EmailService` internally, `MyController` accepts an `IEmailService` instance through its constructor. This allows `MyController` to use any implementation of `IEmailService` without modifying its code.

By using dependency injection, the code becomes more modular and testable, as it's easier to mock or substitute dependencies during testing. It also makes it easier to change dependencies in the future without affecting the rest of the codebase.
