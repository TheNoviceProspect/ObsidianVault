## Initial Setup
- Make sure we have access to a "shared" folder (smb)
- From outside world, ensure separate access to SE servers via differing ports (eg: hostname:25016 hostname:25017)
- When setting IPs for each wormhole instance' settings, we need to fill in the **public** ip/port for each wormhole
