This is hosted on two servers:

[[Dedicated Server Stuff/Machines/Gozer]] --> Space Engineers (modded) PC (this had originally been spawned as a XBox world)

[[Dedicated Server Stuff/Machines/Gozer2]] --> Space Engineers (vanilla) Xbox

ignore this for now --> [[Dedicated Server Stuff/Machines/Egon]] --> Space Engineers (modded) PC (this will be generated as a PC World)

## For Discord

To make use of our Discord2SpaceEngineers integration, make sure you are in the #a-space-engineers-odyssey channel 
and that in game you've issued `/f` once so you are chatting in faction chat.

### For Discord Mods

The servers will report their status to #se-server channel every time they come up or are going down.
Also general chat is projected into here (for now, I may change that)
