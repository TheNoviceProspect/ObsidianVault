please note that any of the below pieces of advice aren't *The Meta* but are observations made through our own failings.
(I will even provide anecdotal "*evidence*" where I can)

## Single Player/Campaign Games

- It may behove anyone recording, to store a *separate* save game at the end of each episode (where this is feasible)
`So, imagine recording a whole episode (nevermind the outcome) and then afterwards you realize there's no audio from one source or another`

## Multiplayer Games

- When recording on shared multiplayer servers for your community it would be really advantageous to have another member of
  your community recording from their perspective.
`Again, you loose part of your recording, you can fall back to other footage for that segment`
