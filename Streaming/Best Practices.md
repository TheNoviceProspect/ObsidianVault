please note that any of the below pieces of advice aren't *The Meta* but are observations made through our own failings.
(I will even provide anecdotal "*evidence*" where I can)

# Rule #1 of Streaming
You don't talk about streaming...
I mean:
Don't rely on your stream reaching the platform (YT, Trovo, et al.) <-> **Always Record every bit of footage**

# Rule #2 How can I prevent loss of footage?

<small>The sad truth is, you.. you.. eh.. 

you.. you can't..

Sorry boss.. No can do..</small>


but here's a few strategies to help when, no, **if** it happens:

## Single Player/Campaign Games

- It may behove anyone recording, to store a *separate* save ga*6me at the end of each episode (where this is feasible)
`So, imagine recording a whole episode (nevermind the outcome) and then afterwards you realize there's no audio from one source or another`

## Multiplayer Games

- When recording on shared multiplayer servers for your community it would be really advantageous to have another member of
  your community recording from their perspective.
`Again, you loose part of your recording, you can fall back to other footage for that segment`
